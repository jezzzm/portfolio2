I’m a full-stack developer with a 6 year background in biomedical engineering, consulting, and sales.

Since my teenage years, I’ve been a hobbyist web designer and developer, obsessed with all things technology! This year I decided to change careers and commit to full-time education in pursuit of software development. I began with self-study using a variety of online resources, and for the last quarter of 2019, I’m undertaking the full-time Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly in Sydney. The project's I've completed for the course are below.

Upon completion of the course, I’m excited to begin work as a developer and sink my teeth into projects where my problem solving skills and attention to detail can make a positive difference.
